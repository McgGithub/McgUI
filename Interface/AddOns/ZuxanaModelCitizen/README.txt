Version:  0.9.3
Release:  2006-01-18
About:    A 3D model add-on which creates several adjustable cameras
          of differing unit types.

---------------------

Note for version 0.9.3:

There is not yet a configuration menu or any slash commands.
To control each bounding box and camera here are the controls:

SHIFT Key + Left Mouse Button = Drag the bounding box around.
SHIFT Key + Right Mouse Button = Resize the bounding box.

CTRL Key + Left Mouse Button = Rotate and Zoom in on the model.
CTRL Key + Right Mouse Button = Pan the model horizontally or vertically.

With the current WoW API, I am unable to determine relative model scale.
This means that if you target a human model and adjust it to be waist up,
you'll be lucky to see the top of a gnomes head when you change targets
to a gnome model. I will be thinking creatively on how to tackle this
issue but it may very well be here to stay unless Blizzard gives me the
tools needed to compensate the camera difference.

A configuration menu is on the way. Please be patient.
